  <h3><b>BrainLab</b> – Deep-learning, Pairwise Image Registration</h3>
	GitHub - <i>Coming soon!</i><br><br>

  Under the tutorage of Dr. Maged Goubran &amp; Ahmadreza Attarpour at Sunnybrook's <a href="http://brainlab.ca">BrainLab</a>, I am developing an unsupervised, deep-learning method for deformable, pairwise image registration on tissue cleared microscopy data.<br>
  <h3><b>LearnAI</b> – UofT AI's Director of Education &amp; LearnAI Lead</h3>

  <a href="./projects/LearnAI-2021Syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a> - 2021-2022 LearnAI Syllabus<br><br>

	UofT AI is an undergraduate-run club at the University of Toronto. LearnAI, its free subsidiary course, teaches U of T undergraduates practical ML. I am currently the club Director of Education, and have proudly spearheaded all LearnAI affairs for the past 2 years.<br><br>

  LearnAI has recently partnered with <a href="https://ai-commons.org/">AI Commons</a> to bring the content to emerging countries for free! Knowledge of AI should be accessible to all.

  <h3><b>notMNIST</b> – PyTorch Letter Classification Model</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/notMNIST_model">GitHub</a><br><br>

  This little classification project on the notMNIST_small dataset was an exercise in proper argument parsing, visualization of multiple training runs, and using TensorBoard with PyTorch.<br><br>
  It was also an exploration of PyTorch’s dataloaders (such as ImageFolder), transforms, optimizers, and sequential modelling functionalities!

  <h3><b>Illegible</b> – Full-Page Preprocessing for Handwriting Recognition</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/PreprocessingHTR">GitHub</a><br><br>

	This project was an exercise in advanced computer vision preprocessing: Take an image of a full-page handwritten document and prepare it as singular word images for offline, word-based
  handwriting recognition.<br><br>

  <h3><b>Reincarnating Bob Ross</b> – Character-Level LSTM on YouTube Transcripts</h3>
	<a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/TranscriptGeneratingLSTM">GitHub</a><br><br>

	The goal of this project is to make the following as straight-forward as possible: Perform LSTM character-level generation on automatically extracted YouTube transcripts. Personally, I tackled this project to re-create the dear, late Bob Ross' painting videos:<br><br>

  <b>Prompt</b>: “welcome back. certainly glad you could join us today, it's a fantastic day here. let's have them run all”<br><br>

  <b>Generated</b>: ... “the colors across the screen, there we go. now then, we'll take a little bit of the bright-red and let's put some of the same colors and then we'll put a little bit of the bright-red in the sky. there we go. now, little touch of the bristles, we'll go right into the yellow-ochre”
  
  <h3><b>Facing Racial Bias</b> – Developing An Unbiased Emotion Recognition Method</h3>
	<a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/EmotionRecognition">GitHub</a> - <i>Work in progress</i><br><br>
  
  Emotion recognition is fraught with <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3281765">racial bias</a>, which I aim to investigate and minimize.<br><br>
