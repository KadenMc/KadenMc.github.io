  <h3><b>BrainLab</b> – Deep-learning, Pairwise Image Registration</h3>
	GitHub - <i>Coming soon!</i><br>

  At <a href="http://brainlab.ca/index.html">BrainLab</a>, I am developing an unsupervised, deep-learning method for deformable, pairwise image registration, with a focus on brain tissue.<br><br>

  This deep-learning registration is formulated as a function that maps an input image pair to a deformation field that aligns these images.<br><br>

  The aim is to integrate this method into BrainLab's MIRACL pipeline, complimenting <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13374-0">non-ML based registration methods</a> such as ANTs, which are effective, but slower by several orders of magnitude.<br><br>


  <h3><b>LearnAI</b> – UofT AI's Director of Education &amp; LearnAI</h3>

  <a href="./projects/LearnAI-2020Syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a> - 2020-2021 LearnAI course syallbus<br>

	UofT AI is an undergraduate-run club at the University of Toronto. LearnAI, its free subsidiary course, teaches U of T undergraduates practical ML.<br><br>
  
  I am currently the club Director of Education, and have proudly spearheaded all LearnAI affairs for the past 2 years.<br><br>

  LearnAI has recently partnered with <a href="https://ai-commons.org/">AI Commons</a> to bring the content to emerging countries for free! Knowledge of AI should be accessible to all.

  <h3><b>Illegible</b> – Full-Page Pre-processing for Handwriting Recognition</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/PreprocessingHTR">GitHub</a><br>
	This project was an exercise in advanced computer vision pre-processing: Preparing the image of a full-page handwritten document for offline, word-based
  handwriting recognition.<br><br>

  <h3><b>Reincarnating Bob Ross</b> – Character-Level LSTM on YouTube Transcripts</h3>
	<a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/TranscriptGeneratingLSTM">GitHub</a><br>
	The goal of this project is to make the following as straight-forward as possible: Perform LSTM character-level generation on automatically extracted YouTube transcripts.<br><br>
  Personally, I tackled this project to re-create the dear, late Bob Ross' painting videos.<br><br>

  <b>Prompt</b>: “welcome back. certainly glad you could join us today, it's a fantastic day here. let's have them run all”<br><br>

  <b>Generated</b>: ... “the colors across the screen, there we go. now then, we'll take a little bit of the bright-red and let's put some of the same colors and then we'll put a little bit of the bright-red in the sky. there we go. now, little touch of the bristles, we'll go right into the yellow-ochre”
  
  <h3><b>Facing Racial Bias</b> – Developing Unbiased Emotion Recognition</h3>
	GitHub - <i>Coming soon!</i><br>

  Me and my fellow UofTAI clubmates discovered that emotion recognition is fraught with <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3281765">racial bias</a>.<br><br>

  We aim to address this injustice, and create a CNN-based model with little to no bias.<br><br>
