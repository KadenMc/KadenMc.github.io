  <h3><b>BrainLab</b> – Unsupervised Image Registration</h3>
	GitHub - <i>Coming soon!</i><br><br>

  Developing a pipeline for deformable, unsupervised, pairwise image registration under the tutorage of Dr. Maged Goubran &amp; Ahmadreza Attarpour at Sunnybrook's <a href="http://brainlab.ca">BrainLab</a>.<br>

  <h3><b>LearnAI</b> – UofT AI's Director of Education &amp; LearnAI Lead</h3>

  <a href="./projects/LearnAI-2021Syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a> - 2021-2022 LearnAI Syllabus<br><br>

	UofT AI is a club at the University of Toronto; LearnAI, its course, teaches U of T undergraduates practical ML.
  I proudly spearheaded LearnAI as the club Director of Education for three years.<br><br>

  We partnered with <a href="https://ai-commons.org/">AI Commons</a> to expand our reach and empower people in emerging countries!

  <h3><b>notMNIST</b> – PyTorch Letter Classification Model</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/notMNIST_model">GitHub</a><br><br>

  This classification project on the notMNIST_small dataset was an exercise in proper argument parsing, visualization, and using TensorBoard with PyTorch.
  It was also an exploration of PyTorch’s dataloaders (such as ImageFolder), transforms, optimizers, and sequential modelling functionalities!

  <h3><b>Illegible</b> – Full-Page Preprocessing for Handwriting Recognition</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/PreprocessingHTR">GitHub</a><br><br>

	This project was an exercise in computer vision preprocessing: Take an image of a full-page handwritten document and prepare it as singular word images for offline handwriting recognition.<br><br>

  <h3><b>Reincarnating Bob Ross</b> – Character-Level LSTM on YouTube Transcripts</h3>
	<a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/TranscriptGeneratingLSTM">GitHub</a><br><br>

	Perform LSTM character-level generation on automatically extracted YouTube transcripts. I tackled this project to recreate the late Bob Ross' painting videos:<br><br>

  <b>Prompt</b>: “welcome back. certainly glad you could join us today, it's a fantastic day here. let's have them run all”<br><br>

  <b>Generated</b>: ... “the colors across the screen, there we go. now then, we'll take a little bit of the bright-red and let's put some of the same colors and then we'll put a little bit of the bright-red in the sky. there we go. now, little touch of the bristles, we'll go right into the yellow-ochre”
  
  <h3><b>Facing Racial Bias</b> – Developing An Unbiased Emotion Recognition Method</h3>
	<a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/EmotionRecognition">GitHub</a> - <i>Work in progress</i><br><br>
  
  Emotion recognition is fraught with <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3281765">racial bias</a>, which I aim to investigate and minimize.<br><br>
