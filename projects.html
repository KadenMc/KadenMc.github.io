  <h3><b>LearnAI</b> – UofT AI's Director of Education &amp; LearnAI</h3>
	UofT AI is an undergraduate-run club at the University of Toronto. LearnAI, its free subsidiary course, teaches U of T undergraduates practical ML.<br><br>
  
  I am currently the club Director of Education, and serve as lead on LearnAI's curriclum creation.<br>

  The curriclum consists of various ML topics which you can see here: <a href="./projects/LearnAI-2020Syllabus.pdf">View the syllabus!</a>

  <h3><b>Illegible</b> – Full-Page Pre-processing for Handwriting Recognition</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/PreprocessingHTR">GitHub</a><br>
	This project was an exercise in advanced computer vision pre-processing, preparing the image of a full-page handwritten document for offline, word-based
  handwriting recognition.<br><br>

  <h3><b>Reincarnating Bob Ross</b> – Character-Level LSTM on YouTube Transcripts</h3>
	<a href="https://github.com/KadenMc/TranscriptGeneratingLSTM">GitHub</a><br>
	The goal of this project is to make the following as straight-forward as possible: Perform LSTM character-level generation on automatically extracted YouTube transcripts.<br><br>
  Personally, I tackled this project specifically to re-create the late Bob Ross' painting videos. My future plans include training a neural voice cloning model to read the generated transcripts!<br><br>

  <b>Prompt</b>:<br>
  “welcome back. certainly glad you could join us today, it's a fantastic day here. let's have them run all”<br><br>
